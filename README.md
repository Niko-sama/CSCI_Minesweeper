Code for CSCI128 final project. The in progress project is located in the 'minesweeper.py' file. Currently, this includes use of the pygame module, as well as previous features. Older versions of my code are also included.
The images used by the pygame module are located in the images folder. The python code uses the relative directory of these files.
